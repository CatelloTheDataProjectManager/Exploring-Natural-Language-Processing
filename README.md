# Exploring pre-trained models - GPT-2, BERT, ChatGPTðŸ¤–

## GPT-2:

- Demonstrations on text generation using GPT-2 model.

## BERT:

- Utilization of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for natural language processing tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis.
- Loading pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer, followed by an example of sentiment analysis.

###### (Modeling and Multivariate Regression are essential tools for understanding how these pre-trained models work and how they can be effectively used to solve complex natural language processing problems.

## Sentiment Analysis:

- Creation of a dataset for sentiment analysis containing sample sentences and corresponding sentiments.
- Implementation of sentiment prediction function using BERT and application on the dataset.

**Why sentiment analysis is important for businesses ? ðŸ’¡**

Sentiment analysis is vital for businesses as it helps understand customer opinions, improve products/services, enhance customer experience, manage crises, analyze competitors, conduct market research, and aid in decision-making.

## ChatGPT:

- Integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT model for generating conversational responses.
- Examples of generating responses to given prompts using ChatGPT.
- Utilization of ChatGPT for answering specific questions like crafting effective prompts and commenting on sentiment analysis results.
