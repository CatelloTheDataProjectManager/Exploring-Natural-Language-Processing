      "Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest. Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood. She loved to ride all over the forest, and was always well-behaved. She came to the village often to enjoy the view outside after sunset—even when the weather wasn't perfect. But every year, as she got used to more and more of all things sunny and nice, she got tired of doing her jobs. When the sun rose out and you were no longer in the forest, she would call up their parents and say, \"How long are you going on with your life?\" Little Red Riding Hood would ask for her to leave. If they didn't come, she didn't even need to leave—she just needed to stay because that's what she did with her friends every day. There was never a day that she didn't look forward to spending time with her friends, her family, her school, and family who never came to see her. They all loved her, including the one who always called back when she couldn't be seen.\n",

      "The little girl that did the work had a sense of entitlement, she thought. She was so lucky to have a long life, she thought now and then that her ability to do good or good or goodness is over. As an adult she never felt like she had an outlet, and had no desire to go home and put those feelings down. As her life got harder and harder, she came to realize that everyone's experiences have little to do with how much she makes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the fall that summer. A rainy and dreary day in December. Little Red Riding Hood, in her red riding cloak and dark gray dress (with dark hair, no eyebrows), would walk into a store and buy a gallon of water. That was the only thing she had ever wanted to do. She wanted enough milk, or milk and milk. It only took a couple of minutes to break her legs. Little Red Riding Hood sat down on a couch at the front of the store, took a bucket of flour, and added milk. They started out by sitting on the floor. She looked over, and saw a group of people standing round one end of the table with coffee cups to sell. They poured over some water and tossed to the men; no one thought to pour anything over again\n",

When the boy came to a place or two to visit, the girl said that this boy was coming too, but it wasn't necessary to stop him or the girl. When both of them went home, something happened. The girl from the village went out, and the boy from the village came to her house. The girls from the village went home, and the boy from the village came to hers. The little girl went out on her knees, and the girl from the village lived in her carriage.\n",

The only reason she came to such high school was when the kids went out to play with Little Red Riding Hood, but then she became a little girl, started playing with those guys and started playing with them as well, and it became a big thing. The boy girl was named Princess Blue. She was the princess of the school and she was the princess' teacher. He used to get the girl on his doorstep with him all the time and she used to always get out of the house, and she was always going over from school, but then as soon as he came home he came in, and he was always right there in the house. He thought Little Purple was going out, so he said she can go into the school and play with you. So with Little Red Riding Hood he gave her that and she would stay with him every day for many years. She would take things to school and get dressed and go for home.\n",
      "The old teacher once told a story about the old man before he died saying that when he was a little kid he took a bunch of people's old clothes and they carried them. On their way back home from school, they got caught stealing that old clothes, and then on the way to school when they came to the village from the village they spotted a figure walking on the road, like a little girl. Then a policeman came and they said Princess Green (Poppa) said \"I thought something must have happened to you.\" The policeman called Little Green, and she answered her mother's question, and then Princess Green started walking on her back and went home.\n",
